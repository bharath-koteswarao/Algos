--> Suffix tree is a tree constructed in the following manner:
1) Find all the suffixes of the string
   Eg : For 'banana' the suffixes are :
        banana
         anana
          nana
           ana
            na
             a
2) Now construct a trie with all the suffixes
    Now just compress this trie and this is the suffix tree
