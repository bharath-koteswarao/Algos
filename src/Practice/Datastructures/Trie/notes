--> Tries can insert and find strings in O(L) time L is the length of the string
--> The trie is a tree where each vertex represents a single word or a prefix.
--> The root represents an empty string (“”), the vertexes that are direct
    sons of the root represent prefixes of length 1,
    the vertexes that are 2 edges of distance from the root represent prefixes of length 2,
    the vertexes that are 3 edges of distance from the root represent prefixes of length 3
    and so on. In other words, a vertex that are k edges of distance
    of the root have an associated prefix of length k.
--> Let v and w be two vertexes of the trie, and assume that v is a direct father of w,
    then v must have an associated prefix of w.

--> Nice picture of a trie that contains these words

        for tries

--> Main disadvantage with tries is that they require large amount of memory. They are fast but
    also requires huge amount of memory

--> Tries only work for a-z or A-Z and spaces are not allowed
